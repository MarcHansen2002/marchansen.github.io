	Back in 2020 I created a project for college over the summer, a game based in the west using unreal engine 4. I kept working on this project as I had a passion for it.
	I eventually went to release the game on steam in December that year. It had 9 bosses with weapons, abilities and armour that boosts stats from each boss, cutscenes
	for the each of them too. Unfortunately I hadnt had the time to keep working on the game since, however I recently managed to get some more free time and have updated the
	game to using Unreal Engine 5 and started doing a lot of code optimisations in preparation for a large revamp update of the game, making it feel and run much better.
	(Hopefully making it look nicer too but I'm not artist so there's no promise on that part).
