	These projects are projects I made a very long time ago or were small tech demos that I felt deserved a place on my portfolio but not an entire page for them.
	Because of this, the projects do not have any links to downloads or sourcecode / repositories available but do have videos from when they were made.

	<ul>
		<li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
		<li>Blueprints</li>
		<li>2 People Project</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Office apocalypse was created by me and a friend during our second year of college for an assignment. I did all the blueprinting for the game whilst my friend worked
	on models, textures and level design. The game included 5 different weapons with unique upgrades for them all with the 2nd upgrade being split into one or the other.
	The game also included a boss at the end of the game and score calculations so you could compare how well you did with others with an F to S grading system depending
	on the score achieved.

	<ul>
		<li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
		<li>Blueprints</li>
		<li>Infinite world loading</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Block Battles was a project I worked on for a short while wanting to created a minecraft-like sandbox world with infinite generation without having the game lag too much.
	The world loads chunks around the player and allows them to destroy and place new blocks and saves them whenever they leave the area and need to be unloaded. A third person
	camera view and toggle was also added with a very minecraft-looking player model.

<h2>Wizards Of The West - First steam release (Unreal Engine 4)</h2>

<div>

	<ul>
		<li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
		<li>Blueprints</li>
		<li>Steam-release</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Wizards Of The West was the first major game I worked on in unreal engine 4. I had made smaller projects before this but this was my first one that I had a strong passion for.
	The game ended up being released on steam on the 20th of December 2020. Admittedly I should have gave the game much more work before releasing it on steam but at that point
	I had just wanted to release something. Although unsuccessful it was still an extremely fun process and great learning experience for releasing games on steam. I would've
	loved to had kept working on this game and had planned to, with 2 updates coming out within fairly short timing from the original launch date. However, this could not happen
	due to starting uni and getting a job leaving me with little time to update this game.

<h2>Design Course Assignement - Unreal Engine 4</h2>

<div>

	<ul>
		<li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
		<li>Blueprints</li>
		<li>AI</li>
		<li>Dialogue Trees</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	This was a project for an assignment when I was on the games design course before swapping to computer science for games. For the assignment we had to create a puzzle-like
	game involving certain elements. Within this project I decided to add an extra feature not required for fun, I made a fully functional dialogue tree system that was modular
	and could be re-used for almost anything. The tree would allow 4 different responses to a text and have different branching replies based on what you selected. The project
	also included a controllable crane that could lift and move an object.
