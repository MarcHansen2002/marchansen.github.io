<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Marc and I'm currently studying computer science for games at Sheffield Hallam.
<br>I enjoy writing code in my free time and not just during uni so I've decided to program this site as a portfolio for all my work to be on display.</p>

<!-- WHAT I CAN DO -->
<h1>What can I do?</h1>
<p>Before just listing all my projects I thought it'd be best if I mentioned what software & languages I'm familiar with.
<br><br>
<strong>Unreal Engine 4/5</strong> - I started using unreal engine and it's blueprint system in college around the start of 2020 and have been using it regularly since.
<br><strong>Unity</strong> - Unity and C# scripting is only something I've recently started using alongside a group project game in university about a month ago,
however I've been using the software a lot since then as I had some difficulties starting out with it and wanted to learn more about making games in 2D
<br>
<strong>C++ with SFML</strong> - At the begining of the uni year we were taught the basics of C++ and eventually moved onto rendering sprites with C++ ending with
making a small and simple game for an assignment. I ended up creating a flappy bird like game with this and would like to work on more projects with this eventually.
<br>
<strong>HTML</strong> - I haven't really touched HTML much. I touched it once back in secondary school (around about 2017). As of creating this site I have been starting to
learn more about HTML though to create this portfolio.
